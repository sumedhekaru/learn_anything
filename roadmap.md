# App Development Roadmap: LLM-based Adaptive Q&A Application (Subject-Agnostic)

This roadmap outlines all major steps required to build a fully working, extensible Q&A app that supports any conceptual subject area (e.g., ML, AI, physics, etc.). The plan ensures alignment with business requirements and rubric-based grading. Each milestone is listed in order. Simple tasks are listed directly; complex tasks are broken into sub-tasks.

---

## 1. Setup & Initial Configuration
1. Create OpenAI API key
2. Set up project directory and initialize git repository
3. Create a Python virtual environment and requirements.txt
4. Install core dependencies (FastAPI, OpenAI, SQLite, etc.)
5. Add grading_rubrics.txt and business_requirements.md for ongoing reference

## 2. Basic FastAPI Application
5. Create a basic FastAPI app (hello world endpoint)
6. Set up project structure (e.g., `app/`, `db/`, `models/`, `api/`)

## 3. Database Design & Integration (Query-Based)
7. Design SQLite schema for Q&A tracking
8. Implement database connection logic and all queries using raw SQL (no ORM)
9. Add migration/init scripts (if needed, using raw SQL)

## 4. Core Q&A Functionality
10. Implement endpoint: Get available subjects/categories (subject-agnostic, conceptual focus)
11. Implement endpoint: Generate conceptual question (using OpenAI LLM, ensure no calculation-based questions for subjects like physics)
12. Implement endpoint: Submit answer
13. Implement rubric-based, multi-dimensional answer grading logic (correctness, completeness, clarity, depth)
    - Reference grading_rubrics.txt for criteria and scoring
    - Map rubric scores to overall grade (accurate, partially accurate, inaccurate)
14. Implement feedback/model answer generation
    - Provide multi-dimensional feedback for each criterion
    - Include model answer or explanation after grading
15. Store all Q&A interactions, rubric scores, feedback, and timestamps in the database using raw SQL queries

## 5. Adaptive Learning Engine
16. Track user performance and question history
17. Implement adaptive logic to select next question difficulty/topic
18. Reinforce concepts if user struggles at a level

## 6. User Experience & API
19. Implement session/user management (single or multi-user)
20. Implement endpoints for user progress and analytics
21. Add endpoint to review past questions and feedback

## 7. Web UI (Jinja2 + FastAPI)
22. Set up Jinja2 templating with FastAPI for server-side rendered web pages
23. Implement UI templates: subject/category selection, Q&A flow (subject-agnostic, conceptual focus)
24. Display feedback, rubric scores, multi-dimensional feedback, and model answers in templates
25. Show progress and history in the web UI (basic analytics, extensible for future dashboard)

## 8. Voice Mode (Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech)
26. Research and select TTS and STT libraries/services (e.g., Google, Azure, Coqui)
27. Integrate text-to-speech for reading questions, feedback, and model answers
28. Integrate speech-to-text for user answers
29. Add UI controls for seamless switching between voice and text modes

## 9. Advanced Features & Polish
30. Add analytics dashboard (visualize progress, strengths, weaknesses by subject, difficulty, and rubric criteria)
31. Support for more subjects/categories (ensure extensibility for any conceptual domain)
32. Add user profiles and authentication (optional, for tracking and personalization)
33. Error handling, input validation, and security review
34. Write tests for core functionality (unit/integration, especially grading and feedback logic)
35. Add deployment scripts (Docker, cloud, etc.)
36. Write documentation (README, usage guide, rubric explanations)

## 10. Launch & Iterate
37. Deploy app to production environment
38. Collect user feedback and iterate on features
39. Plan and implement future enhancements

This plan is designed to guide you from the first line of code to a fully-featured, production-ready adaptive Q&A application. Check off steps as you complete them, and break down any large steps further as needed for clarity or project management.
